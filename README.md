## Overview
### Description
This application will help users find a place to eat by presenting a random restaurant in their area. The user will be allowed to swipe in order to discard or save restaurants that they would be interested in visiting. Details like location, reviews, menu, and best sellers will be presented under the details of the restaurant.
